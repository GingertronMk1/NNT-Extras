# The Six Degrees Of The NNT

You know the Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon? Yeah, this is that for the Nottingham New Theatre

It ignores backstage roles, but now takes into account Freshers' Fringes, mostly for completeness sake

Furthermore, it should work with any theatre/group of performances, as long as said groups can be represented by a tuple of the form (Show Name, List Of Actors)

To use, you want the Haskell Platform:
- Go to [here](www.haskell.org/downloads#platform)
- Pick your platform
- Install using the provided instructions

You also want a local copy of the NNT's history project
- Go to [here](www.github.com/newtheatre/history-project)
- Download the folder and put it in the same directory as the one containing this folder

To actually play around with it:
- Navigate to this folder in your terminal
- `ghci 6degs`
- Have fun!
